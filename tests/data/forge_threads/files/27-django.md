## Primary keys

### Automatic primary key

Django adds an integer `id` field when no primary key is declared. The `pk` attribute is an alias
for the primary key.

```py
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField()

def _(book: Book):
    reveal_type(book.id)  # revealed: int
    reveal_type(book.pk)  # revealed: int
```

A subclass inherits the primary key behavior of its parent.

```py
class Ebook(Book):
    pass

def _(ebook: Ebook):
    reveal_type(ebook.id)  # revealed: int
```

### Custom primary key

An explicit primary key determines the type of `pk` and prevents Django from adding `id`.

```py
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    isbn = models.CharField(max_length=13, primary_key=True)

def _(book: Book):
    reveal_type(book.isbn)  # revealed: str
    reveal_type(book.pk)  # revealed: str

    # This is an error now, `id` is not created when a custom primary key is defined.
    book.id  # error: [unresolved-attribute]
```

Subclassing a model with a custom primary key inherits the primary key behavior and does not
introduce an automatic `id` field.

```py
class Ebook(Book):
    pass

def _(ebook: Ebook):
    reveal_type(ebook.isbn)  # revealed: str
    ebook.id  # error: [unresolved-attribute]
```

### Explicit `id` field

An explicitly declared `id` keeps its field type:

```py
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    id = models.CharField(max_length=13, primary_key=True)

class Ebook(Book):
    pass

def _(book: Book, ebook: Ebook):
    reveal_type(book.id)  # revealed: str
    reveal_type(ebook.id)  # revealed: str
```

## Foreign key IDs

### Automatic primary key

A `ForeignKey` field `author` can be used to access the referenced `Author` instance via `.author`.
It also creates an `.author_id` attribute which contains that instance's primary-key value:

```py
from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    pass

class Book(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    editor = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, related_name="edited_books")

def _(book: Book):
    reveal_type(book.author)  # revealed: Author
    reveal_type(book.author_id)  # revealed: int

    reveal_type(book.editor)  # revealed: Author | None
    reveal_type(book.editor_id)  # revealed: int | None
```

A `ForeignKey` adds a reverse accessor to the related model. By default, its name is the lowercase
source model name followed by `_set`. The `related_name` parameter overrides this name:

```py
def _(author: Author):
    # TODO: Should not be an error, and the type should be `QuerySet[Book]`.
    # error: [unresolved-attribute]
    reveal_type(author.book_set.all())  # revealed: Unknown

    # TODO: Should not be an error, and the type should be `QuerySet[Book]`.
    # error: [unresolved-attribute]
    reveal_type(author.edited_books.all())  # revealed: Unknown
```

Setting `related_name="+"` disables the reverse accessor:

```py
class Review(models.Model):
    reviewer = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="+")

def _(author: Author):
    author.review_set  # error: [unresolved-attribute]
```

### Custom primary key

The type of `<field>_id` follows the related model's primary key, which need not be an integer:

```py
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    isbn = models.CharField(max_length=13, primary_key=True)

class Review(models.Model):
    book = models.ForeignKey(Book, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

def _(review: Review):
    reveal_type(review.book)  # revealed: Book

    reveal_type(review.book_id)  # revealed: str
```

### Explicit target field

With `to_field`, `<field>_id` contains the value of that field instead of the primary key. In the
following example, the foreign key refers to the `isbn` field, not to `Book`'s primary key (`id`):

```py
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    id = models.IntegerField(primary_key=True)
    isbn = models.CharField(max_length=13, unique=True)

class Review(models.Model):
    book = models.ForeignKey(Book, to_field="isbn", on_delete=models.CASCADE)

def _(review: Review):
    reveal_type(review.book)  # revealed: Book

    reveal_type(review.book_id)  # revealed: str
```

## Choices

The `choices` parameter can be used to map the actual stored values for a field to human-readable
labels. Django adds `get_<field>_display()` methods for fields that have `choices` defined:

```py
from django.db import models

class Article(models.Model):
    status = models.CharField(
        max_length=1,
        choices=[("D", "Draft"), ("P", "Published")],
    )
    visibility = models.CharField(
        name="access",
        max_length=1,
        choices=[("P", "Public"), ("R", "Private")],
    )

article = Article(status="P")

reveal_type(article.status)  # revealed: str
reveal_type(article.get_status_display())  # revealed: str
```

An explicit `name` determines the names of generated methods, overriding the assignment name:

```py
reveal_type(article.get_access_display())  # revealed: str

# A `get_<field>_display()` method for the original field name is not available.
article.get_visibility_display()  # error: [unresolved-attribute]
```

## Date navigation

Django adds `get_next_by_<field>()` and `get_previous_by_<field>()` methods for date fields that do
not have `null=True`. These methods return the next/previous instance of the corresponding model
when ordered by that specific date field:

```py
from django.db import models

class Article(models.Model):
    published = models.DateField()
    updated = models.DateTimeField()
    reviewed = models.DateField(null=True)

def _(article: Article):
    reveal_type(article.get_next_by_published())  # revealed: Article
    reveal_type(article.get_previous_by_published())  # revealed: Article

    # Date fields with `null=True` do not generate these methods.
    article.get_next_by_reviewed()  # error: [unresolved-attribute]
    article.get_previous_by_reviewed()  # error: [unresolved-attribute]
```

`DateTimeField` also generates these methods:

```py
def _(article: Article):
    reveal_type(article.get_next_by_updated())  # revealed: Article
    reveal_type(article.get_previous_by_updated())  # revealed: Article
```

Keyword arguments filter the candidate instances:

```py
def _(article: Article):
